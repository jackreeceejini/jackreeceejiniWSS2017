Project title: Building an emotion categorization system with the Wolfram language
Project description: The next thing for computers to master are human emotions. While current sentiment analysis systems focus on binary output to categorize sentiment, i.e. as positive or negative, building functional emotion categorization systems that recognize the full range of human emotions or a reasonable subset is still a challenge. Projects like conceptnet commonsense reasoning system have made good strides on this path but there are still shortfalls in thier functionality. My goal in this project is to build a resilient emotion categorization system using data from various sources like the sentic net project, etc. It is my hope that using some of the machine learning capabilities built into the Wolfram language I will be able to achieve this goal
